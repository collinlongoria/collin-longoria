<h2>Original Description: </h2>
<p>The year is 3049. The GREAT WAR has ended, and the world is controlled by Private Corporations.

You play as Mek AND Rakk. These two men were special, as their minds were connected via a (you guessed it) MIND CONNECTING DEVICE!

The only problem?

One dies, they BOTH DIE!

This is the story of the DOWNFALL of RealTek and the RISE of Mek and Rakk.
