Original Description: 
</h2>
<p>
After hitting a world famous chef with your car, it is up to you to keep the restaurant at 5-stars. Problem is, you don't exactly know how to cook... or what most ingredients even are. Worse, everyone seems to act like you should already be a pro at this. How unfair is that?

Please Note: This game has no audio. It was a submission for a Game Jam and I ran out of time. I may get around to this after the jam has ended.
