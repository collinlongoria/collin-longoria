Original Description: 
</h2>
<p>
Craniux: Post-Mortem is a roguelike RPG centered around collecting loot as a dungeon-descending skeleton fighting other skeletons. Made for a Game Jam and is horribly unbalanced, but is still decently fun to play.

-over 25 weapons, 25 armor pieces, 30 enemies, 10 items, and 15 spells.


(Made in ~1 month for a Game Jam)
