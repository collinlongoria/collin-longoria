Original Description: 
</h2>
<p>
Prepare to embark on an epic quest... IN SPACE!

Uncover the mysteries in this Metroid inspired experience!

You are a part of the now defunct group known as the Blue Pioneer's, a group of scientist and explorers created by the US government before the downfall of Earth and society living on the N.E.A.B. Everyone else in the Blue Pioneer's are dead, but your love for exploration continues on. You recently discorvered a space station, one similar to a manmade structure yet so far from anywhere a human would be, it must be alien. Upon entering it, you find it's been overrun by some sort of fungal infection. It's up to you to save the day...
